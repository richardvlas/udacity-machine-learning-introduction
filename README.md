## Projects

### Supervised Learning 

[Find Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/richardvlas/udacity-machine-learning-introduction/tree/master/finding_donors)

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. The goal is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent to ask for donations.

### Deep Learning

[Create an Image Classifier](https://github.com/richardvlas/udacity-machine-learning-introduction/tree/master/image_classifier)

Implement an image classification application using a deep learning model on a dataset of images. You will then use the trained model to classify new images. First, you will develop your code in a Jupyter notebook, then convert it into a Python application that you will run from the command line of your system.

### Unsupervised Learning

[Creating Customer Segments](https://www.google.com/)

Use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers and use those similarities to segment customers into distinct categories using various clustering techniques. This segmentation is used to help the business make more informed marketing and product decisions.
