## Project: Create an Image Classifier

Project code for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning Nanodegree program. In this project, Python code is first developed for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then it is converted into a command line application.

We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories.
